      <p>
        I'm 30 years old, and have always had a physical labor job. My body is breaking down, and I need something that is going to work my mind more than my body. 
        I have friends in the Web Dev industry, and I took a Computer Science course in high school through Red Rocks Community College and really enjoyed it. 
      <br> 
        This is the next step to creating a career that can help me provide for my family.
